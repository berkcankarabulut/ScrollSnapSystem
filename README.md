Unity Scroll Snap System
This project is a modular Scroll Snap system for Unity's UI, designed to manage scrolling and snapping functionality efficiently. It includes automatic scrolling, manual drag support, and button controls.

ðŸš€ Features
âœ… Modular Structure: The Snap class provides the core functionality, while ScrollSnap and AutoSnap extend its capabilities.
âœ… Smooth Transitions: Uses Lerp for seamless scrolling animations.
âœ… Automatic Snapping: AutoSnap smoothly aligns items based on the set speed.
âœ… Drag Support: ScrollSnap implements IBeginDragHandler and IEndDragHandler for user interaction.
âœ… Previous/Next Buttons: Navigation buttons for easy control.

ðŸ“‚ Code Structure
Snap.cs â†’ Base class managing the snap mechanism

ScrollSnap.cs â†’ Handles drag input and button-based navigation

AutoSnap.cs â†’ Performs automatic scrolling with smooth transitions

SnapPositionCalculator.cs â†’ Helper class for position calculations

ðŸ“¦ How to Use
Add the ScrollSnap or AutoSnap component to a Scroll View object.

Assign Snap items (RectTransform elements).

(Optional) Set up Previous/Next buttons for navigation.

ðŸŽ‰ You're ready to go! Smooth scrolling and snapping are now working.

ðŸ›  Potential Improvements
ðŸ“Œ Using SmoothDamp instead of Lerp for even smoother motion.
ðŸ“Œ Making SnapPositionCalculator a static class to optimize memory usage.
ðŸ“Œ Adding null checks for scrollPanel to improve error handling.
